    "## The steps\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: you need to understand your data and verify that it doesn't contain errors\n",
    "   - do as much EDA as you can!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "     Feature engineering (if needed): change or add new x's: x1 -> x1^2\n",
    "     \n",
    "     Feature selection: eg. 100 features， 选 15 个最有用的features\n",
    "      \n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Split the data into different sets**: most often the sets are train, validation, and test (or holdout)\n",
    "   - practitioners often make errors in this step!\n",
    "   - you can split the data randomly, based on groups, based on time, or any other non-standard way if necessary to answer your ML question\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Preprocess the data**: ML models only work if X and Y are numbers! Some ML models additionally require each feature to have 0 mean and 1 standard deviation (standardized features)\n",
    "   - often the original features you get contain strings (for example a gender feature would contain 'male', 'female', 'non-binary', 'unknown') which needs to be transformed into numbers\n",
    "   - often the features are not standardized (e.g., age is between 0 and 100) but it needs to be standardized\n",
    "\n",
    "    Dealing with the missing values in ordinal and categorical features, leave the the missing values in continuous features. \n",
    "    \n",
    "**4. Choose an evaluation metric**: depends on the priorities of the stakeholders\n",
    "   - often requires quite a bit of thinking and ethical considerations\n",
    "     \n",
    "**5. Choose one or more ML techniques**: it is highly recommended that you try multiple models\n",
    "   - start with simple models like linear or logistic regression\n",
    "   - try also more complex models like nearest neighbors, support vector machines, random forest, etc.\n",
    "    \n",
    "**6. Tune the hyperparameters of your ML models (aka cross-validation)**\n",
    "   - regularization if over fitting ()\n",
    "   - ML techniques have hyperparameters that you need to optimize to achieve best performance\n",
    "   - for each ML model, decide which parameters to tune and what values to try\n",
    "   - loop through each parameter combination\n",
    "       - train one model for each parameter combination\n",
    "       - evaluate how well the model performs on the validation set\n",
    "   - take the parameter combo that gives the best validation score\n",
    "   - evaluate that model on the test set to report how well the model is expected to perform on previously unseen data\n",
    "    \n",
    "**7. Interpret your model**: black boxes are often not useful\n",
    "   - check if your model uses features that make sense (excellent tool for debugging)\n",
    "   - often model predictions are not enough, you need to be able to explain how the model arrived to a particular prediction (e.g., in health care)"
