## Overview
Sepsis is a critical medical condition with high mortality rates. The goal of this project is to predict whether hospitalized patients with sepsis are likely to survive or not, based on key features such as age, sex, and episode number.  

We applied several machine learning models, evaluated using the AUC-PR metric, and focused on addressing the minority class (deceased patients).

## Dataset
The dataset comprises **110,204 hospital admissions** from Norway (2011â€“2012). It includes:
- **Age** (numeric)
- **Sex** (male/female)
- **Episode Number** (categorical)
